# DVLATask

DVLA Task is located under dvla Package

I have created a Example class to demonstrate the task

I have used Regex and substring options to split the registration number and to identify the area code and year of registration with it

I have created a method to check if the registration number is valid or not which returns a boolean value

the area code and year will be retreived only if the method value is true
